A javascript library for diffing text and generating corrected and annotated text.  This is a fork and derivative of
[ForbesLindesay/jsdifflib](https://github.com/ForbesLindesay/jsdifflib), which is in turn a fork of [cemerick/jsdifflib](https://github.com/cemerick/jsdifflib)

## Installation

    npm install diff-compare

## Overview

diff-compare is a Javascript library that provides:

1. a partial reimplementation of Pythonâ€™s difflib module (specifically, the SequenceMatcher class)
2. rather than a view generator, as the previous modules have made, this provides a corrected list of items, language agnostic

## Example

```js
var diff = require('diff-compare');

var adjustedText = diff.build({
  baseText: baseText,
  newText: newText
})

```
